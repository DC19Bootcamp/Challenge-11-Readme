#  Challenge 11: README Generator

The index.js file is the entry point of the application, and it uses the inquirer package to prompt the user for information about their project. The answers are then passed to the generateMarkdown.js file, which generates the final Markdown content based on the provided user input. The generateMarkdown.js file exports a function that takes in an object of user inputs and returns a string of formatted Markdown text. Together, these files form a simple CLI application that generates a README file for a project.
